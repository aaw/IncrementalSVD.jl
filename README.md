# IncrementalSVD.jl

### What is this?

Simon Funk's singular value decomposition implemented in [Julia][].
Collaborative filtering that can analyze millions of ratings on a laptop in a few minutes.

### What does that mean?

If you have a set of user ratings, saves, follows, etc., you can use this package to turn
those ratings into:
* Predictions of how users might rate other items.
* Clusters of similar items and similar users.
* Identification of important features in your data.

### What is a singular value decomposition?

The [singular value decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)
(SVD) factors any _m_ by _n_ matrix _M_ into an _m_ by _m_ matrix _U_, an _m_ by
_n_ diagonal matrix _S_, and an _n_ by _n_ matrix _V_ such that _M_ = _USV<sup>T</sup>_. One
of the many interesting properties of this decomposition is that you can choose
any _r_ < _n_, create a new matrix _T_ from _S_ by zeroing out anything that
isn't on the first _r_ rows and columns in _S_, and then _UTV<sup>T</sup>_ is the closest
matrix of rank _r_ to _M_ in terms of the Frobenius norm (in other words, over
all rank _r_ matrices _N_, _N_ = _UTV<sup>T</sup>_ minimizes the sum of the squared
differences between _N_ and _M_.)

### How do you use an SVD to build a recommendation engine?

Let's say that you have a large set of movie ratings. Consider some cluster
of similar movies, say, the Friday the 13th horror franchise. One user's ratings of
the Friday the 13th movies are probably pretty consistent:
either they like the series and rate all of the Friday the 13th films pretty high or they don't
like any of them and rate them all pretty low. In addition, maybe the first couple of films in
the series were a lot better than the later ones, so even users who didn't really like the
series would rate Friday the 13th part I and II a little higher.

If you wanted to build a really simple model of these Friday the 13th ratings,
you could just set up a vector of base ratings (say, 1.0 for the first
two films, then 0.8 for all of the rest) and fit each user's predictions
by finding the multiple of that vector that best fits all of the ratings you have from that user.
Given a user who rated only Friday the 13th part II and gave it a 5/5, we'd
just multiply the base ratings vector by 5 to get that user's predicted ratings for the entire series:
5/5 for part I and II and 4/5 for the rest. The resulting vector follows our imagined model
for ratings of the series and it also agrees on the one actual rating we know from the user.

Now imagine putting all of the movie ratings you have into one big user-by-item matrix.
Somewhere in there, you'd have 12 columns for Friday the 13th movies, one for each movie in the series.
Since we can't force our users to watch and rate all of the movies in the series, what we see in
those columns is some sparse sample of ratings. Taken as vectors projected on just those 12 columns,
it's pretty likely that we'd need a basis of size 12 to represent them all (this would be true, for
example, if there are 12 users who have each only rated a single different Friday the 13th film.)
But that's a basis for the sparse set of known ratings, not the dense set of predicted ratings.
What we'd actually like is a basis of smaller rank the like single-vector basis we used in
the previous paragraph that generalizes the sparse, observed ratings.

That's where the SVD comes in: we can choose a small rank and extract a matrix of exactly that rank
from the SVD. The resulting matrix will still approximate the original matrix, so decreasing the
rank will just smooth out
the ratings by forcing them to be linear combinations of only a few basis vectors while matching
our sparsely observed ratings as closely as possible. And the best part is that you don't even need to
have specific knowledge of the domain that you're trying to extract information about - in this case,
the Friday the 13th movies aren't annotated in any way, but as long as we have enough ratings that
follow the linear ratings model that we described earlier, the SVD will cluster those movies together
simply because it's the easiest thing to do under the sum of squared differences penalty.

### Great, but Julia already has an `svd` function. I'll just use that.

Computing an SVD of a user-item matrix is expensive. If you have reasonable
numbers of users or items, you may not even be able to fit the matrix in memory to begin with.
More importantly, a model based on a reduced-rank SVD minimizes the error on both the sparse
set of ratings you know and on the dense set of unknown ratings you're trying to predict.
You can initialize the unknown entries based on some prior instead of setting
them all to zeros, but when you compute an SVD over the entire matrix,
you're penalizing both the differences from your known ratings and the differences from your
predictions of unknown ratings equally, and there are typically many more unknown ratings than known
in the ratings matrix. So you end up essentially fitting the model to your prior when you'd like to
fit the model only to your observed ratings instead.

### So what does this package do that's different than an SVD?

Simon Funk's algorithm creates a decomposition that attempts to minimize the sum of squared
errors against only the known ratings. It finds this decomposition via gradient descent,
which along with the fact that you're only considering a (relatively) small number of ratings
instead of the entire user-item matrix means that it's fast and you can run it on any machine
that can hold all of your ratings in memory.

### Where can I read more about Simon Funk's algorithm?

The gradient descent approach to SVD originated in a
[2005 paper by Funk and Gorrell]. Simon Funk then popularized this approach by using
it to do exceptionally well in the [Netflix Prize competition][] in 2006 and writing
up a series of posts about his implementation:

* [Introduction][]
* [More detail on the algorithm][]
* [Derivation of the gradient descent update rule][]

There's also a good [discussion][] in the Netflix prize forum about
implementing and tuning Funk's algorithm on the Netflix Prize dataset.

### How do I install this package?

```julia
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/aaw/IncrementalSVD.jl"))
```
or
```Julia
pkg> add https://github.com/aaw/IncrementalSVD.jl
```

### How do I use this package build a recommendation engine?

IncrementalSVD comes with functions to load two benchmark datasets for
collaborative filtering: the [MovieLens dataset][] and the [Book-Crossing dataset][].
Let's load the small MovieLens dataset:

```julia
julia> import IncrementalSVD

julia> rating_set = IncrementalSVD.load_small_movielens_dataset();
```

The small MovieLens dataset has 1 million ratings from 6000 users over 4000 movies.
Train a model with 25 features on these ratings:

```julia
julia> model = IncrementalSVD.train(rating_set, 25);
```

More later on how to choose a good number of features, for now just consider 25 a lucky guess.
The truncated SVD that we generated with the above command gave us, among other things, a
matrix U, which has dimension [number of users] x 25, and a matrix V, which has dimension
[number of movies] x 25. You can use either of these matrices as feature vectors for your
users or movies. You can compare these vectors using, say, [cosine similarity][] to get
a list of similar movies to use for clustering or recommendations. For example,

```julia
julia> IncrementalSVD.similar_items(model, "Friday the 13th (1980)")
10-element Array{String,1}:
 "Friday the 13th (1980)"                  
 "Amityville Horror, The (1979)"           
 "Jaws 2 (1978)"                           
 "Pet Sematary (1989)"                     
 "Omen, The (1976)"                        
 "Porky's (1981)"                          
 "Cujo (1983)"                             
 "Stepford Wives, The (1975)"              
 "Halloween II (1981)"                     
 "Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)"

julia> IncrementalSVD.similar_items(model, "Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)")
10-element Array{String,1}:
 "Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)"                       
 "Halloween II (1981)"                                 
 "Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985)"      
 "Porky's II: The Next Day (1983)"                     
 "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)"           
 "Cujo (1983)"                                         
 "Damien: Omen II (1978)"                              
 "Towering Inferno, The (1974)"                        
 "Missing in Action (1984)"                            
 "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, A (1989)"
```

Looks like the first Friday the 13th is clustered together with some classic scary movies,
while part 2 and later get clustered together with some lower-tier scary movies.

The MovieLens dataset identifies movies by their title and year of release, so there's a
helper function that lets you search for a movie by a case-insensitive substring of the title:

```julia
julia> IncrementalSVD.item_search(model, "godfather")
3-element Array{String,1}:
 "Godfather: Part III, The (1990)"
 "Godfather, The (1972)"
 "Godfather: Part II, The (1974)"

julia> IncrementalSVD.similar_items(model, "Godfather, The (1972)")
10-element Array{String,1}:
 "Godfather, The (1972)"
 "Godfather: Part II, The (1974)"
 "GoodFellas (1990)"
 "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)"
 "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)"
 "Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)"
 "Taxi Driver (1976)"
 "Apocalypse Now (1979)"
 "Saving Private Ryan (1998)"
 "L.A. Confidential (1997)"
```

So what are the features in these 25-dimensional feature vectors we're using? The first
feature is a line through our ratings data in the direction it varies the most:

```julia
julia> IncrementalSVD.show_items_by_feature(model, 1)
3706-element Array{String,1}:

You might call this first feature "well known versus obscure movies". Unfortunately, you have to come
up with interpretations of these features - they're just whatever your ratings data suggests:

```

The second feature is more obviously something like "art house versus mainstream blockbuster". The model
also lets investigate similar users and user features just like we did with items, it's just not that
interesting to look at the anonymized user ids
in these public data sets. If you wanted to, say, create a dating site and suggest partners based on
movie/book ratings, those user-centric functions might be more interesting to explore.

Finally, you can use the model to get predicted numeric ratings for specific users and movies. Let's
look a little closer at one particular user:

```julia

Among other things, this user seems to love movies about dystopian futures (Gattaca, 12 Monkeys, Brazil) and
dislike movies that involve dancing (Dirty Dancing, Flashdance, Grease 2). So what might that user
think of another dystopian future movie like Blade Runner?

```julia
julia> IncrementalSVD.predicted_rating(model, "3000", "Blade Runner (1982)")
4.257683865384008
```

And what would the same user think of Footloose?

```julia
julia> IncrementalSVD.predicted_rating(model, "3000", "Footloose (1984)")
2.810785878396833
```

### How do I know that the results are any good?

[Root-mean-square error][] (RMSE) is commonly used to measure predictions like these. It measures the average
difference of a predicted rating to the actual rating over all actual ratings in some test set.
All of the datasets loaded by this package hold out
around 10% of the ratings for testing RMSE. After you've trained a model on a rating set, calling
`IncrementalSVD.rmse(rating_set, model)` will calculate the RMSE on the test ratings, none of which
were seen by the model during training.

You can also pass a specific rank (something less than the total rank of the model) to the `rmse` function to see
what the RMSE would have been on the same model had you stopped adding features a little earlier. If you called
`model = IncrementalSVD.train(rating_set, 50)`, you could then call `IncrementalSVD.rmse(rating_set, model, rank=i)` for any
`1 <= i <= 50` to find the best rank in that range. If you find a rank with better RMSE, you can truncate your
existing model by calling `IncrementalSVD.truncate_model!(model, rank)` to convert it into a model with smaller
rank and better RMSE.

We don't round predicted ratings or ceiling/floor them if they go out of range in `IncrementalSVD.rmse`. This
makes the RMSE returned a little worse than it could be. RMSE is a very informative statistic but optimizing it
isn't the goal of this package.

### What other datasets does this package load?

This package has built-in support for loading and cleaning three datasets:

* `load_small_movielens_dataset`: 1 million ratings from 6,000 users over 4,000 movies. Ratings are in the range 1 (lowest)
  to 5 (highest). You should be able to train
  25 features in about 5 minutes on this dataset with an RMSE of around 0.91.

* `load_large_movielens_dataset`: 10 million ratings from 72,000 users over 10,000 movies. Ratings are in the range 1 (lowest)
  to 5 (highest). You should be able to train 15 features in about an hour on this dataset with a resulting RMSE of around 0.8.
  RMSE tends to keep going down as you add more features, so keep training if you have the time.

* `load_book_crossing_dataset`: 1.1 million ratings from about 278,000 users over about 271,000 books. Ratings are in
  the range 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest), but zeros mean that the user read the book but didn't rate it. This data comes
  from a crawl of the bookcrossing.com site and needs a lot of cleaning before you can
  do anything useful with it. During loading, we throw away any rating by a user who hasn't rated at least 30 books and
  given at least 6 distinct numeric ratings and we also throw away any rating of a book that hasn't been rated at least
  30 times. In additions, we remap the ratings onto the range 1-6: everything from 0-5 becomes 1 and the rest of the
  ratings are scaled down by 4. This leaves about 190,000 ratings in the range 1-5 by 3900 users over 3900 books. You
  should be train a model with 30 features in about a minute with an RMSE a little over 1.5.
